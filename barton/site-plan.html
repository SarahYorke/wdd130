        Barton is a life changing curriculum and even if you don't use me as your tutor I would still recommend it one hundred percent! Dyslexia can manifest itself in many different ways but that doesn't mean it's unbeatable and barton is a great way to get started. My Barton tutor was so great and really helped me grow and I hope to be that person to others as well.

      <p>
        My name is Sarah Yorke. I graduated from Barton reading and writing and it honestly changed my life! I am 16 years old and I have 12 siblings and multiple of them have dyslexia too. One thing that has helped me learn is that while dyslexia can be a challenge It does not mean you are unintelligent or broken. And I would love to help others learn that too!

      <h3>About Barton</h3>
      <p>
        Barton Tutoring is a specialized program designed to help individuals with dyslexia build strong reading, spelling, and writing skills. Using the research-based Barton Reading & Spelling System, I provide structured, multisensory lessons tailored to each studentâ€™s needs. This method breaks language down into manageable steps, helping students gain confidence and develop lifelong literacy skills.
