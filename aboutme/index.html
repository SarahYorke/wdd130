    <h2>Sarah Yorke</h2>
    <p>I’m sixteen years old and currently a junior in high school. I’m also enrolled in the dual enrollment program, which means I’m earning college credits while finishing high school. My goal is to get a job in website design, a field I’m really excited about. I live in Missouri and enjoy school and spending time with my family</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love reading good books or solving puzzles—they are great ways to unwind. A unique thing about me is that I come from a big family. I have twelve siblings: three sisters and nine brothers, which definitely keeps life interesting and crazy!</p>
    <p>I’m looking forward to doing this class with all of you!</p>
